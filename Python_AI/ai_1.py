1 . The code defines a function called pre_process_code(). This function removes comments, whitespace, and other unnecessary things from code.
2 . The code gets the list of code files in the dataset.
3 .The code iterates over the code files and pre-processes each file using the pre_process_code() function.
4 .The code writes the pre-processed code to a new file with the extension .preprocessed.

Once the code has finished running, you will have a new directory containing the pre-processed code files. You can then use these files to train your AI model to generate Python code.

Here is how this code fits into your overall project:
1. You have collected a dataset of Python code.
2 . You are now pre-processing the dataset to remove comments, whitespace, and other unnecessary things.
3 . Next, you will train an AI model to generate Python code using the pre-processed dataset.
4 .Finally, you will deploy the AI model so that it can be used to generate Python code on demand. """
